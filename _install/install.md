The simplest way to use `AutoMerge` is to download the pre-built 
[jar](https://github.com/thufv/automerge/releases/download/v1.0/automerge-v1.0.zip).

Extract the archive and type `java -jar AutoMerge.jar` for CLI options help.

For those who would like to develop on the top of `AutoMerge` or `JDime`,
we recommend you to clone/fork
[our repository](https://github.com/thufv/automerge){:target="_blank"}.

For more information on installation steps and usages, please read the 
[instructions](https://github.com/thufv/automerge/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}.
