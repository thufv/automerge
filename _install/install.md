The simplest way to use `AutoMerge` is to download the pre-built [jar file]().

Extract the archive and type `java -jar AutoMerge.jar` for CLI options help.

For those who would like to develop on the top of `AutoMerge` or `JDime`,
we recommend you to fork [our repository]().

For more information on installation steps and usages,
please read the [instructions](https://github.com/thufv/automerge/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}.
